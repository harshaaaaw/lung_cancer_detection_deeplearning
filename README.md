## 🚀 Project Overview

Detecting lung cancer at an early stage can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project leverages the power of **Deep Learning** to analyze medical images (CT scans) and accurately predict the presence of lung cancer.



### Key Features

- **State-of-the-art Deep Learning Models**: Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process 3D CT scan images.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced the diversity of training data through transformations.
- **Performance Metrics**: Emphasized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC for comprehensive evaluation.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built an intuitive UI for non-technical users to interact with the model.

## 🧠 Data Science Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

- **Data Source**: Used the [Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC)](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI) dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed noise and irrelevant features from the dataset.
- **Segmentation**: Employed advanced image segmentation techniques to isolate lung regions from CT scans.


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization**: Generated heatmaps, distribution plots, and 3D visualizations to understand the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.



### 3. Model Building

- **Architecture**: Designed a custom CNN architecture tailored to 3D medical image data.
- **Training**: Employed techniques like dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
- **Optimization**: Used Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling for efficient training.

### 4. Model Evaluation

- **Cross-validation**: Implemented K-fold cross-validation for robust model assessment.
- **Performance Metrics**: Focused on metrics critical to medical diagnosis, including sensitivity and specificity.


### 5. Deployment

- **Framework**: Deployed the model using Flask, allowing easy access via a web interface.
- **API Integration**: Built REST APIs for seamless integration with other applications.
